                For someone to advocate for developers, they must understand
                what it means to work be a developer. They must have lived
                the struggle of trying to deliver a best-in-class product on
                short deadlines with substandard tooling. I have six years of
                professional experience as a full-stack software engineer, most
                recently at SpaceX. I want to use this technical depth to help
                developers succeed despite the pressures of their industry.

                I have a non-standard background for a software engineer. I have
                a degree in creative writing, and I spent the
                beginning of my career writing and editing for the web. The
                skills I learned in school and at work have been foundational in
                my career, allowing me to communicate effectively regardless of
                topic or setting, and I feel as comfortable discussing details
                with teammates as I do broad strokes with stakeholders.

                A great communicator must have the compassion to meet others
                where they are. The prose we write and the words we say mean
                nothing if the recipient is not considered. I care deeply about
                the experience of those around me. I want to raise all ships, to
                bring people in, to pay forward the support I've received
                throughout my career. I want to help developers feel great in
                their work, and I believe I have the skill and empathy to do it.
